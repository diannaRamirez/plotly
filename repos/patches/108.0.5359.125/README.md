# build/compute_build_timestamp.py

Google has a complex way to embed a timestamp into all of their source files and libraries. It has to do with cache optimization and symbol lookup for proprietary servers they have. It didn't work in 2024 and their most recent build (which we can't use yet) doesn't even have this file. But I just replace the file with a simple timestamp since that's suitable for Kaleido's purposes.
